# Shopify Backend Developer Challenge

This is the repository for a web application that allows users to create an account to add/delete images from their inventory. The images are saved in an SQL database that stores user account information and the images that they've added. The Flask python framework was used for the backend and JavaScript/HTML/CSS was used for the front end. 

You can view the app [here](https://backend-developer-challenge.herokuapp.com/). If you're in a rush, there is an option to sign in as a guest to test functionality.
